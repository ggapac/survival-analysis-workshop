# Workshop: Introduction to Survival Analysis

This is a code repository for a workshop titled Introduction to Survival Analysis in a series of workshops held by the DataScience@UL-FRI Initiative.

## Workshop Details
- **Date and Time:** March 28, 2024, 16:00 - 20:00
- **Location:** UL-FRI, Lecture room 3
- **Instructors:** Greta Gašparac & Martin Špendl

## Instructor Information
- **Greta Gašparac:** Data Scientist at Sportradar, Master’s degree in Computer and Data Science. [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greta-gasparac/)
- **Martin Špendl:** Data Science Master’s student, coauthor of Survival Analysis related papers. [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mspendl/)

## Event Description
This workshop targets academics, professionals, and students interested in survival analysis, a crucial branch of statistics for modeling time-to-event data. Familiarity with R, statistics, and/or machine learning is helpful but not required.

We are going to introduce the main concepts of survival analysis, including:
- theoretical background of time-to-event data and censoring
- the meaning of hazard, survival functions and risk
- comparison of multiple curves with log-rank test and restricted mean survival time
- non-parametric models (Kaplan-Meier estimator)
- parametric models (Exponential and Weibull)
- semi-parametric models (Cox Proportional hazard)
- survival machine learning approaches
- predictive modeling and evaluation
- designing your own study

## Workshop Agenda
- **16:00 - 16:30:** Introduction to Time-to-Event Data & Censoring
- **16:30 - 17:00:** Survival and Kaplan-Meier Curves
- **17:00 - 17:20:** Comparison of Survival Curves
- **17:20 - 17:30:** _Break_
- **17:30 - 18:15:** Survival Model Inference
- **18:15 - 19:00:** Predictive Modelling in Survival
- **19:00 - 19:15:** _Break_
- **19:15 - 20:00:** Practical Examples and Study Design
