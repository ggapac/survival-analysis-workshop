# Introduction

TO DO: Describe different namings, definition, examples

## Fundamental concepts

$T$ ... non-negative continuous random variable representing the time until the event occurs

$f(t)$ ... probability density function

$F(t) = P(T < t)$ ... cumulative distribution function

$S(t) = P(T \geq t) = 1 - F(t)$ ... survival function

$h(t) =\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$... hazard rate

$H(t)$ ... cumulative hazard

## Censored data

What distinguishes survival analysis from other areas in statistics is the data that are usually censored.

Censored data is **any data for which we do not know the exact event time**.

We distinguish between Type I and Type II censoring:

-   In Type I censoring we observe all individuals for a specific time period or until failure.

-   Type II censoring design can often be found in engineering, where a total of *n* objects are observed and the study ends when *r* of them fail.

Observations can be *point-censored* or *interval-censored*. Let's take a look at point censoring:

Interval censoring is shown in the bottom figure:

Now let's get to know our data.

## The Rossi experiment

The dataset we’ll be working with today is one that was published in Peter H. Rossi, Richard A. Berk and Kenneth J. Lenihan’s 1980 book, *Money, Work, and Crime: Some Experimental Results* (<https://gwern.net/doc/sociology/1980-rossi-moneyworkandcrime.pdf>). The dataset is made available in the R *carData* package, and is described as follows:

> This data set is originally from Rossi et al. (1980), and is used as an example in Allison (1995). The data pertain to 432 convicts who were released from Maryland state prisons in the 1970s and who were followed up for one year after release. Half the released convicts were assigned at random to an experimental treatment in which they were given financial aid; half did not receive aid.

The [documentation page](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/carData/Rossi.html) describes the columns that are present in the dataset.

```{r}
library(carData)
dat <- Rossi
summary(dat)
```

Let's get to know our data better.

```{r age}
ggplot(dat, aes(x=age)) + geom_bar() + theme_bw()
```

```{r categorical}
binary_cols <- c("fin", "wexp", "mar", "paro")
summary(dat[, binary_cols])
```

```{r education}
ggplot(dat, aes(x=educ)) + geom_bar() + theme_bw()
```

```{r week}
ggplot(dat, aes(x=week)) + geom_bar() + theme_bw()
```

```{r arrest}
summary(dat[, "arrest"])
```

**Q: What type of censored data are we dealing with?**

In this workshop, we focus on the Type I censoring design, our data is right-censored and we assume non-informative censoring, which means that the distribution of survival times provides no information about the distribution of censorship times and vice versa.

## How to handle censored data?

-   **Complete data analysis**: ignore the censored observations

-   **Imputation**

-   **Dichotomized data analysis**

-   **Likelihood-based approach**

TODO: There are better ways to explore survival data. Survival curves, KM plots, hazard functions etc.
