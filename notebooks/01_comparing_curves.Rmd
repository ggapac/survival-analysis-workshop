# Comparing Survival Curves

Survival curve by itself tells you the proportion of the population surviving though time.
It also tells you the median survival of the samples.

But how about when you want to compare two groups or subgroups of the population?

## Two Kaplan-Meier curves

```{r}
library(survival)
library(survminer)

library(carData)
dat <- Rossi
```


```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
surv_obj <- Surv(time = dat$week, event = dat$arrest)

# Fit Kaplan-Meier survival curve using 'fin' as the group
km_fit <- survfit(surv_obj ~ paro, data = dat)

# Plot the Kaplan-Meier curves
ggsurvplot(km_fit, data = dat, conf.int = TRUE, 
           ggtheme = theme_minimal(), 
           title = "Kaplan-Meier Curves by Parole",
           palette = c("#00AFBB", "#FC4E07"),
           legend.title = "fin",
           ylim = c(0.5, 1))
```


Let's compare CUMULATIVE hazard functions.
```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
# Create a survival object
surv_obj <- Surv(time = dat$week, event = dat$arrest)

# Estimate cumulative hazard functions using Nelson-Aalen method
cum_haz_fit <- survfit(surv_obj ~ paro, data = dat, type = "fleming")

# Plot the cumulative hazard functions
ggsurvplot(cum_haz_fit, data = dat, fun = "cumhaz", conf.int = TRUE,
           ggtheme = theme_minimal(), 
           title = "Cumulative Hazard Curves by Parole",
           xlab = "Time", ylab = "Cumulative Hazard",
           palette = c("#00AFBB", "#FC4E07"),
           legend.title = "fin")

```

## Log-Rank Test

Log-Rank test is the most widely used test for comparing two survival curves.

It is based on the Chi-squared test with one degree of freedom.

### Chi square test

Chi-square test follows the equation:

$\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E},$

where O is the number of observations and E the expected number of observations.

### Log-rank in R

```{r}
log_rank_test <- survdiff(Surv(week, arrest) ~ paro, data = dat)
print(log_rank_test)
```

### Example

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
surv_obj <- Surv(time = dat$week, event = dat$arrest)

# Fit Kaplan-Meier survival curve using 'fin' as the group
km_fit <- survfit(surv_obj ~ wexp, data = dat)

# Plot the Kaplan-Meier curves
ggsurvplot(km_fit, data = dat, conf.int = TRUE, 
           ggtheme = theme_minimal(), 
           title = "Kaplan-Meier Curves by fin",
           palette = c("#00AFBB", "#FC4E07"),
           legend.title = "fin",
           ylim = c(0.5, 1))
```

```{r}
log_rank_test <- survdiff(Surv(week, arrest) ~ wexp, data = dat)
print(log_rank_test)
```

### Considerations

There is one hidden property of the log-rank test we have to take into account.
It assumes the PROPORTIONALITY OF HAZARDS.

Proportional hazards assumption tells you that the hazard rate of one cohort divided by the hazard rate of the other is constant.
Meaning, hazards are proportional in time and the ratio is constant.
We are going to find this assumption once again in the modeling section.

Log-rank test also considers only if two curves differ, but not by how much. Does not handle crossings of curves well.

## Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST)

Restricted mean survival time does not make a PH assumption. It's a prefered metric in clinical trials.

We need to apply domain knowledge to restrict the survival time. Samples with long survival have large impact on RMST.

```{r}
library(survival)

# Creating the dataset
data <- data.frame(
  Time = c(2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 10),
  Event = c(1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1),
  Cohort = c("A", "A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B", "B", "B", "B")
)

# Convert to survival object
surv_obj <- with(data, Surv(Time, Event))

# Fit a Kaplan-Meier survival model for each cohort
km_fit_A <- survfit(surv_obj ~ Cohort, data = data, subset = (Cohort == "A"))
km_fit_B <- survfit(surv_obj ~ Cohort, data = data, subset = (Cohort == "B"))

# Define a function to calculate RMST
calculate_rmst <- function(km_fit, tau) {
  times <- km_fit$time
  surv_probs <- km_fit$surv
  
  # Ensure times are within the specified limit tau
  valid_times <- times[times <= tau]
  valid_surv_probs <- surv_probs[seq(length(valid_times))]

  # Add the tau time point if not present
  if (tail(valid_times, n=1) != tau) {
    valid_times <- c(valid_times, tau)
    valid_surv_probs <- c(valid_surv_probs, surv_probs[length(valid_times) - 1])
  }

  # Calculate the area under the survival curve up to tau
  sum(diff(valid_times) * (valid_surv_probs[-length(valid_surv_probs)] + valid_surv_probs[-1]) / 2)
}

# Calculate RMST for both cohorts up to a time limit (e.g., 10)
rmst_A <- calculate_rmst(km_fit_A, 10)
rmst_B <- calculate_rmst(km_fit_B, 10)

# Print the RMST results
print(paste("RMST for Cohort A up to time 10:", rmst_A))
print(paste("RMST for Cohort B up to time 10:", rmst_B))


```

### Showcase on the Rossi dataset

```{r}
surv_obj <- with(dat, Surv(week, arrest))
TIME_LIMIT = 52

km_fit_A <- survfit(surv_obj ~ fin, data = dat, subset = (fin == "yes"))
km_fit_B <- survfit(surv_obj ~ fin, data = dat, subset = (fin == "no"))

rmst_A <- calculate_rmst(km_fit_A, TIME_LIMIT)
rmst_B <- calculate_rmst(km_fit_B, TIME_LIMIT)

# Print the RMST results
print(paste("RMST for Cohort A up to time 52:", rmst_A))
print(paste("RMST for Cohort B up to time 52:", rmst_B))
```
